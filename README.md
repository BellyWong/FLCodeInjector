This Class, created by Fabio Lombardo ( http://www.lombax.it ) acts as a simple
code injector. It can be used to execute blocks of code BEFORE or AFTER a
specific method of an Objective-C object.
The main use is for debugging purposes
It uses method swizzling and supports the following features:

- Swizzling methods with return type of kind: int, float, long, double, id
- Swizzling methods with variable number of arguments, tested with the following type: int, float, long, double, id
- TODO: structs!!!

Feel free to add or modify features of this code.

How to use?

This example implementation executes the NSLog each time inputView is called (even by the system) on UITextField

    FLCodeInjector *anotherInjector = [FLCodeInjector injectorForClass:[UITextField class]];
    [anotherInjector injectCodeBeforeSelector:@selector(inputView) code:^{
        NSLog(@"Before Input View");
    }];
